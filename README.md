# Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit

SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a widely used cryptographic hash function that belongs to the SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) family. It takes an input message of any length and produces a fixed-size 256-bit hash value.

## Features

- The SHA-256 algorithm ensures the integrity and authenticity of the input message by generating a fixed-size hash value.
- SHA-256 offers a high level of collision resistance, making it highly improbable for two different messages to produce the same hash value.

## Functionality

SHA-256 provides the following functionality:

- Given an input message, the tool calculates and displays the corresponding SHA-256 hash value.

## Applications
SHA-256 is useful in so many circumstances! It’s a fast and secure hash function, here are some of the most common ways that it’s used:

- To create website authentication schemes, using JWTs, HMACs and MACs
- To create digital signatures
- To secure blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum
- In anti-viruses, to compare the fingerprints of files and programs
- In version control systems like Git to check if data has changed
